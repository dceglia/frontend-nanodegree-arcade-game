## Instructions for Students prior to Beginning

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## How To

This game is played by using the keyboard arrow keys to move the Sprite in different directions within the board. The object is to get the player across to the water safely within being hit by a bug. If a collision does occur the player will return to the original position for another attempt.

## Contributing

This repository is my attempt at Project 3 as a Udacity FEND student. Therefore, the project is currently not open for contribution.
